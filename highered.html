        A bachelor’s degree is an undergraduate degree in which students study a subject of their choice at an academic institution, 
        and is commonly known as a college degree. Getting a bachelor’s degree can open access to job opportunities, expose you to 
        new ideas, and boost your earning potential. Here are some key things to know about bachelor’s degrees in the US, including how
        much they cost, what’s needed in an application, and whether an online or in-person experience is better for you.

        <h4 style="margin-left: 2%;">CONDITIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE MASTER'S PROGRAM</h4>
        <h5 style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%;">
        The persons who have finished the higher educational institution on programs of the bachelor degree can arrive on training
        in a magistracy. Training in a magistracy is free of charge under the state educational order (grant) and on a paid basis. 
        Citizens of Kazakhstan can enter the magistracy under the grant only once, i.e. the second master's education will be only for 
        a fee. Foreigners can count on education also on a paid basis, if the grant is not defined by international treaties.
        Specialties are advertised through the media 15 days prior to the start of the application process.
        Reception of necessary documents and applications for admission to the magistracy takes place from July 10 till July 30 in the
        higher educational establishments (HEIs) in which training of magistracy is conducted. The site has a service with a complete
        database of universities and masters programs, which will help you choose: where to enroll.</h5>
